# employee-dashboard-test: Employee Dashboard with Department Filtering

## Summary

This project introduces a significant enhancement to the existing Employee Dashboard, focusing on improved data filtering and analysis capabilities. The primary update is the integration of a new "Department" filter, presented as a dropdown select menu. Users can now filter the displayed employee data by specific departments. When a department is selected, the dashboard dynamically updates the key metrics, such as the total employee count and the average salary, to reflect only the employees belonging to the chosen department. An "All Departments" option is also provided, allowing users to easily reset the view and see the aggregated data for all employees across the organization. This update aims to provide more granular insights into departmental performance and statistics.

## Usage

To utilize the new department filtering feature:

1.  **Navigate to the Dashboard:** Access the main Employee Dashboard interface.
2.  **Locate the Department Filter:** You will find a new dropdown select menu, typically labeled "Filter by Department" or similar, usually positioned near other filtering or data controls.
3.  **Select a Department:** Click on the dropdown and choose a specific department (e.g., "Engineering", "Marketing", "HR").
4.  **Observe Dynamic Updates:** Upon selection, the employee count, average salary, and any other relevant employee listings on the dashboard will immediately update to display data exclusively for employees within the selected department.
5.  **Reset View:** To clear the department filter and view data for all employees, simply select the "All Departments" option from the dropdown menu.
